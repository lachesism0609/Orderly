4.2	Frontend Development
The application frontend uses React.js to provide a single page application. This implementation handles rendering for the interface and manages navigation. It also controls state on the client side and provides communication with backend services and cloud services. The structure of the project, the approach to routing, the method for styling the interface, and the solution for manag-ing state are described in this section.

4.2.1	Project Structure
The organization of the frontend code follows a structure under the src directory that uses a de-sign based on separate concerns. The index.js file provides the entry point for the application. This file mounts the main component into the DOM and sets initial configuration for routing and con-text. The App.js file contains the root component. It combines the navigation layout with the main route definitions that control different views. Global styling appears in App.css and index.css. These files contain basic layout rules.
The components directory includes interface components that different views can use. These com-ponents also include helpers for routing. The Navbar.js file implements the navigation bar at the top. This component allows access to main sections for customers and for merchants. Toast.js dis-plays notification messages that appear briefly. These messages show success or error feedback following actions that users perform. PrivateRoute.js and MerchantRoute.js implement logic that guards routes. These components check the current state for both authentication and authoriza-tion before allowing access to pages that require user status or merchant status. This approach places access control in components that are dedicated to that function.
The pages directory contains components that represent pages. These components correspond to the main views that users can navigate to in the application. Files such as Home.js, Restaurants.js, RestaurantDetail.js, Cart.js, Orders.js, Profile.js, Login.js, and Register.js represent the screens that customers use. These screens include browsing restaurants, viewing details for a restaurant, man-aging the shopping cart, reviewing orders from the past, and handling authentication. A subfolder for merchant’s groups pages that merchants use. This subfolder contains MerchantDashboard.js, MerchantMenu.js, MerchantOrders.js, MerchantReviews.js, and MerchantSettings.js. These pages allow restaurant owners to manage menus. They also allow monitoring orders, reviewing feed-back from customers, and adjusting settings for configuration. The separation between pages for customers and pages for merchants shows the application supports dual roles.
The services directory provides an abstraction for interaction with backend systems and cloud plat-forms. This directory contains api.js at present. The module centralizes requests using the protocol to endpoints on backend systems and interfaces that operate in cloud environments. Centralization allows simpler approaches to handling errors and provides a basis for modifying endpoints in later work. The utils directory contains modules that serve functions across different parts of the appli-cation. The firebase.js module establishes the client SDK for Firebase and exposes instances that provide authentication and access to Firestore. The i18n.js module establishes text resources that support multiple languages and are used in the interface. This organization supports separation of responsibilities between components and allows maintenance and extension of the frontend in future development.

4.2.2	Routing (React Router)
Navigation on the client side uses React Router for implementation. This approach allows the ap-plication to function as a single-page application while providing distinct URLs for different views. The main application component contains the configuration that defines routing. The configuration uses routes that are public and routes that are protected.
Public routes provide access to landing pages and browsing pages that do not require authentica-tion. The root path / maps to the Home page. This page presents the application to users and may show restaurants that are featured or categories of restaurants. The /restaurants route provides the Restaurants page that lists restaurants that are available. The /restaurants/:id route renders the RestaurantDetail page for a particular restaurant using the identifier. These routes allow users to examine options that are available before creating accounts or logging in to the system.
Routes for authenticated users require that the customer has logged in to the system. The Priva-teRoute component protects these routes. The /cart route renders the Cart page. This page shows items that the user has selected and allows the user to change quantities or proceed to check out. The /orders route provides the Orders page. Users can examine orders from the past and orders that are current on this page. The /profile route shows the Profile page. This page allows users to examine personal information and make changes to this information. Routes for authentication include /login and /register. These routes map to the Login page and the Register page and pro-vide access to users who have not authenticated.
Routes that are specific to merchants use a dedicated path prefix. The MerchantRoute component provides protection for these routes. This approach confirms that only users who have authenti-cated and have privileges for merchant functions can access these routes. The /merchant base route provides the MerchantDashboard page. This page presents an overview of performance for the restaurant. Subroutes include /merchant/menu, /merchant/orders, /merchant/reviews, and /merchant/settings. These routes correspond to the MerchantMenu page, the MerchantOrders page, the MerchantReviews page, and the MerchantSettings page. This scheme for routing sepa-rates flows for customers and flows for merchants in a clear manner while maintaining structure for navigation that is consistent across the application.

4.2.3	UI and Styling (Tailwind CSS)
The interface uses styling from Tailwind CSS, which is a framework providing utility classes that allow control of layout, spacing, features relating to type, color, and other properties relating to appearance. This framework was selected to increase development rate and to provide consistent design across the interface without requiring maintenance of large numbers of separate CSS files. Using utility classes in the component structure itself means that styling remains connected to the structure of components, and this improves how readable the code appears and makes changes simpler to implement.
Tailwind applies across the main components in the pages and elements that appear multiple times. The Home page, Restaurants page, and RestaurantDetail page use utilities relating to re-sponsive grid and flexbox to show restaurant cards and sections of layout in forms that adapt across different sizes of screen. Buttons and elements that allow interaction show consistent pat-terns in styling, including schemes for color and states when hovering, and these use utility classes from Tailwind. The Navbar component uses utilities from Tailwind to provide a navigation bar fixed at the top that shows responsive form on smaller screens. In the Cart page and Orders page, utilities relating to type and spacing provide clear separation across different sections and show key data including totals for orders and status information. This approach provides an interface that appears coherent and consistent in appearance while the styling layer remains simple to maintain.
State handling in the frontend uses local state in components combined with global state using context to handle authentication, contents of the shopping cart, and forms of interface activity. For interactions that are specific to components, including inputs in forms, whether modals appear, or flags for temporary interface state, React provides a useState hook that is used in individual com-ponents. This maintains simple state near where it is used and prevents complexity that is not re-quired.
State that is shared and requires access across multiple components or pages uses the React Con-text API for handling. The AuthContext module provides state relating to authentication, and this includes the user that is currently in a logged-in state, status of authentication, and functions that help with login and logout. Components including PrivateRoute, MerchantRoute, Navbar, and dif-ferent pages use this context to change the interface depending on whether the user shows au-thenticated status and the role that the user has. This provides consistent handling across the ap-plication for access control and content that is specific to users, including data from profiles and history of orders.
The state for the cart follows a similar approach, with a context structure that maintains items that the user selects, the quantities for these items, and the totals that the system provides from these data. This approach uses a provider that focuses on this function, and different components that show the restaurant details, the listing of restaurants, and the cart view interact with the same state for the cart. The approach provides an experience in which users add items from dif-ferent views and the cart shows these changes in the interface.
The application includes support for multiple languages using settings that appear in the i18n.js file, which contains the resources for translation that the English interface and the Chinese inter-face use. The language that the user selects appears in a state that components share, and this state provides the text that components and views show. The user changes the language, and the application shows different labels and different messages, and this occurs with no requirement that the view reloads. The combination of the context approach for managing state and the i18n settings that the application uses supports an interface that responds to different users and differ-ent conditions that these users present.
